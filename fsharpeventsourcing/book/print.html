<p><a href="https://github.com/tonyx/Micro_ES_FSharp_Lib">Sharpino</a> is a simple F# event sourcing framework.
It is a project for study and for experimenting.
At the moment (2023-08-06) it supports <em>in memory</em> and <em>postgres</em> storages.
There is also an experimental support for eventstoredb.</p>
<p>Here I am giving a quick overview to how it works, how the sample application works (from models to application service layer and without any user interface) and my proposal about the issues of refactoring aggregates (migrating to a different configuration of aggregates).</p>
<h2 id="the-sample-application"><a class="header" href="#the-sample-application">The sample application</a></h2>
<p>The sample application is a simple todo list manager where each todo contains reference to Tags and Categories.
The aggregates manage those categories, todos and tag models.
Particularly the &quot;version 1&quot; of the saple application has an Aggregate managing Todo and Categories, and another aggregate managing Tags.
I will show a strategy for handling the following aggregate refactoring problem: how to migrate from an aggregate configuration to another one.</p>
<p>Particularly there in the &quot;version 2&quot; of the application there are three different aggregates: one for the Todo model, one for the Categories model, and another one from the Tags model.</p>
<p>The challenge is that you can write parametric tests that can be executed against the current and the next aggregate configuration, also by testing the migration function.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="models"><a class="header" href="#models">Models</a></h1>
<p>In Sharpino models are collections of entities.
Usually a model contains references to elements of other models only indirectly, by using their id as a reference.
However there can be exceptions when some models are closely related: for instance you may rather define a model for orders and a model for orderitems in the same place, so that orders will be able to contain direct reference to orderitems instead of their ids.</p>
<p>A Simple model for the todo items:</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    type Todo =
        {
            Id: Guid
            CategoryIds : List&lt;Guid&gt;
            TagIds: List&lt;Guid&gt;
            Description: string
        }
    type Todos =
        {
            todos: List&lt;Todo&gt;
        }
        with
            static member Zero =
                {
                    todos = []
                }
</code></pre>
<p>There is a special &quot;Zero&quot; static member that does not matter so much for the model, but it is important for the aggregate (see the next section). Indeed the <em>Zero</em> static member is mandatory for any aggregate.</p>
<p>Note that in some popular Fsharp technologies some definitions must stay in a separate project whared beteen the client and the server separate projects.
(See Fable remoting for more informations about that).</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/tonyx/Micro_ES_FSharp_Lib/blob/main/Sharpino.Sample/models/TodosModel.fs">TodosModel.fs</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aggregates"><a class="header" href="#aggregates">Aggregates</a></h1>
<p>An aggregate is an instance of a record that handles one or more models. We will be able to recreate the state of the aggregate by processing the stored events by a fundamental function called <em>evolve</em>. The definitions of such <em>events</em> are closely related to some of the members of the aggregate. </p>
<p>Given that the state of the aggregatre is a function of the related events present in the storage, an aggregate needs the following, mandatory, static members:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Zero</strong>: the instance of the aggregate in its intitial state. 
It is needed to be able to provide the state of the aggregate when there is no event stored related to that aggregate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>StorageName</strong> and  <strong>Version</strong>: this combination uniquely identifies the aggragate and lets the storage know in which stream to store events and snapshots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li><strong>LockObject</strong>: (<em>warning: the lockobject concept is obsolete. It was meant to handle single thread processing but at the moment I am providing an actor model based mailboxprocessor to ensure single thread chain command-&gt;events-&gt;eventstoring, so you will skip this part</em>). Before introducing the <em>mailboxprocessor</em> (i.e. an actor model based single thread message processor), the repository was supposed to use aggregate locks while processing command and storing related events ensuring consistency. An application layer was also supposed to use them explicitly to ensure inter-aggregate integrity (invariant conditions involving models handled by separate aggregates).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SnapshotsInterval</strong>: the number of the events that can be stored after a snapshot before creating a new snapshot (i.e. the numer of events between snapshots)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in the <em>in memory</em> or <em>Postgres</em> storage implementation the state of any aggregate is rebuilt starting from the last available snapshot and applying the events that are after the snapshot.
At the moment I have no specific strategy for hadling snapshots and interval between snapshots for the EventStoreDb. </p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    type TodosAggregate =
        {
            todos: Todos
            categories: Categories
        }
        static member Zero =
            {
                todos = Todos.Zero
                categories = Categories.Zero
            }
        static member StorageName =
            &quot;_todo&quot;
        static member Version =
            &quot;_01&quot;
        static member SnapshotsInterval =
            15
</code></pre>
<p>Some members of the aggregate virtually change the state of the aggregate in the sense that they they return the aggregate in a new state or an error. It atually means that such members will do add/upate/delete on their model (still in a functional/immutable way i.e. returning the model with changes). Those members will be associated to specific definition of <em>events</em> (see next section).
In the following example the aggregate of the todos manages also the categories model and so it can check the validity of the categories referenced before adding a todo (you can add only todo with categoryIds related to existing categories).
It uses the &quot;result&quot; computational expression included in the FsToolkit.ErrorHandling library supporting the possibility to handle errors in a <em>railway oriented programming</em> style.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    member this.AddTodo (t: Todo) =
        let checkCategoryExists (c: Guid ) =
            this.categories.GetCategories() 
            |&gt; List.exists (fun x -&gt; x.Id = c) 
            |&gt; boolToResult (sprintf &quot;A category with id '%A' does not exist&quot; c)

        result
            {
                let! categoriesMustExist = t.CategoryIds |&gt; catchErrors checkCategoryExists
                let! todos = this.todos.AddTodo t
                return 
                    {
                        this with
                            todos = todos
                    }
            }
</code></pre>
<p>Recap: invariant conditions related to models residing in the same aggregate can be preserved without the need of explicit transaction, because at that level there is no awareness of the storage. Invariant conditions involving models residing in different aggregates could be preserved as well, but only by the application layer level (see the next sections).</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://github.com/tonyx/Sharpino/blob/main/Sharpino.Sample/aggregates/Todos/Aggregate.fs">TodosAggregate.fs</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="events"><a class="header" href="#events">Events</a></h1>
<p>Events are associated to the members of the aggregate that virtually change the state of the aggregate (i.e. operates  add/update/delete on their models).  They are defined as Discriminated Union (Du) type. </p>
<p>The abstract definition of an Event is: </p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    type Event&lt;'A&gt; =
        abstract member Process: 'A -&gt; Result&lt;'A, string&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>'A</em> is the generic aggregate type the event is associated to.</p>
<p>This is an example of a concrete implementation ov event relate to the TodoAggregate members <em>Add</em> and <em>Remove</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Fsharp">    type TodoEvent =
        | TodoAdded of Todo
        | TodoRemoved of Guid
            interface Event&lt;TodosAggregate&gt; with
                member this.Process (x: TodosAggregate ) =
                    match this with
                    | TodoAdded (t: Todo) -&gt; 
                        x.AddTodo t
                    | TodoRemoved (g: Guid) -&gt; 
                        x.RemoveTodo g

</code></pre>
<p>This shows that processing an event means calling the related aggregate member.</p>
<p>You can cache events by wrapping the member in a lambda expression and passing it to a specific cache manager. </p>
<pre><code class="language-Fsharp">    type TodoEvent =
        | TodoAdded of Todo
        | TodoRemoved of Guid
            interface Event&lt;TodosAggregate&gt; with
                member this.Process (x: TodosAggregate ) =
                    match this with
                    | TodoAdded (t: Todo) -&gt; 
                        EventCache&lt;TodosAggregate&gt;.Instance.Memoize (fun () -&gt; x.AddTodo t) (x, [TodoAdded t]) 
                    | TodoRemoved (g: Guid) -&gt; 
                        EventCache&lt;TodosAggregate&gt;.Instance.Memoize (fun () -&gt; x.RemoveTodo g) (x, [TodoRemoved t]) 
</code></pre>
<p>However, caching events does not show so much improvement so far. Looks more promising the caching of the state of the aggregate (see the next section).</p>
<p>Therefore event Caching is disabled by default. See &quot;EVENTS_CACHING_ENABLED&quot; in the project file: <a href="https://github.com/tonyx/Sharpino/blob/main/Sharpino.Lib/Sharpino.Lib.fsproj">project file</a>
To enabled the caching of events, the library must be compiled with the following compilation symbol: <code>EVENTS_CACHING_ENABLED</code>.</p>
<p>Source:  <a href="https://github.com/tonyx/Sharpino/blob/main/Sharpino.Sample/aggregates/Todos/Events.fs">Events.fs</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="commands"><a class="header" href="#commands">Commands</a></h1>
<p>There is a concrete implementation of command for each aggregate.
We define Commands as Discriminated Union type and, when executed, they will produce a lists of events or an error.
We have also <em>&quot;command undoers&quot;</em>, that allow us to compensate the effect of a command in case it is part of a multiple stream transaction that fails  as we will see later.</p>
<p>The abstract definitions of Command and Undoer  are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">
    type Undoer&lt;'A, 'E when 'E :&gt; Event&lt;'A&gt;&gt; = 'A -&gt; Result&lt;List&lt;'E&gt;, string&gt;

    type Command&lt;'A, 'E when 'E :&gt; Event&lt;'A&gt;&gt; =
        abstract member Execute: 'A -&gt; Result&lt;List&lt;'E&gt;, string&gt;
        abstract member Undoer: Option&lt;'A -&gt; Result&lt;Undoer&lt;'A, 'E&gt;, string&gt;&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    type TodoCommand =
        | AddTodo of Todo
        | RemoveTodo of Guid

        interface Command&lt;TodosAggregate, TodoEvent&gt; with
            member this.Execute (x: TodosAggregate) =
                match this with
                | AddTodo t -&gt; 
                    match x.AddTodo t with
                    | Ok _ -&gt; [TodoAdded] |&gt; Ok
                    | Error x -&gt; x |&gt; Error
                | RemoveTodo g -&gt;
                    match
                        x.RemoveTodo g with
                        | Ok _ -&gt; [TodoEvent.TodoRemoved g] |&gt; Ok
                        | Error x -&gt; x |&gt; Error
            member this.Undoer = None
</code></pre>
<p>It is unusual to define commands such as they will return multiple events, but we can do it, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    type TodoCommand =
        [...]
        | Add2Todos of Todo * Todo
        interface Command&lt;TodosAggregate, TodoEvent&gt; with

                let evolved =

                    [TodoEvent.TodoAdded t1; TodoEvent.TodoAdded t2]

            member this.Undoer

</code></pre>
<p>It is important that any command must ensure that it returns some events only if those events, when applied to the current aggregate state, will return an Ok result (and no error). 
For that reason, before returning the events, I invoked the &quot;evolveUNforgivingErrors&quot; function to probe the sequence of two events to be eventually returned. The evolveUNforgivingErrors applies the events to the current state and will return an error if the result is an error.
The ordinary evolve is able to skip errors and return the state anyway.
Commands can use event caching if it is enabled as we have seen in the previous section.</p>
<h2 id="undoer"><a class="header" href="#undoer">Undoer</a></h2>
<p>A command may have associated an <em>undoer</em> which is similar to a command itself but it is aimed to eventually do the &quot;reverse&quot; of a command, which means  compensating the effect of a command in case such command is a part of a multiple stream transaction that fails. We need the <em>undoer</em> only if the storage lack of multiple streams transactions (which is the case of EventStoreDb)</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    type Undoer&lt;'A, 'E when 'E :&gt; Event&lt;'A&gt;&gt; = 'A -&gt; Result&lt;List&lt;'E&gt;, string&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, as a recap: when the repository uses only in memory or Postgres storage, it doesn't need any <em>undoer</em> because in memory and Postgres storage support multiple stream transactions.
If you will use an EventStoreDb like engine as storage, you may want to provide an undoer for each command in case it will be part of a multiple stream transaction.</p>
<p>I am going to show an example of an undoer but before that let me remind the abstract definition of a command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    type Command&lt;'A, 'E when 'E :&gt; Event&lt;'A&gt;&gt; =
        abstract member Execute: 'A -&gt; Result&lt;List&lt;'E&gt;, string&gt;
        abstract member Undoer: Option&lt;'A -&gt; Result&lt;Undoer&lt;'A, 'E&gt;, string&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This shows that the command may provide an Undoer which is a function that returns an actual undoer (!).
Here is the way we can user an under in a command: given the current state of the aggregate, the &quot;command undoer&quot; returns a function that, applied to the state, actually returns an actual undoer.
So the actual undoer now available is ready to be executed and can return a list of events that can compensate the effect of the command if we need it.</p>
<p>So the undoers works in two shots: one to build a context for the eventual future undo, and one to atually... <em>do</em> the <em>undo!</em>. </p>
<p>Concretely:</p>
<p>The removeTag command returns a list of TagRemoved events. When those events are processed the result is the aggregate without the tags.</p>
<p>In a transaction context if you want to be ready to eventually reverse the effect of the removeTag command you need to readd the tag to the aggregate state. For this reason you need to build a context before the removal so that the tag to be eventually readded is still available.</p>
<p>From the code perspective:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Fsharp">    member this.Undoer = 
        match this with
        | RemoveTag g -&gt; 
            // block to be executed before the actual command removing tag is executed. It will return another function with the context needed (the tag itself)
            (fun (x: TagsAggregate) -&gt;
                result {
                    let! tag = x.GetTag g
                    let result =

                        // block to be executed after the actual command removing tag is executed. It will return the list of events to be applied to the aggregate state to compensate the effect of the command. Note that the tag is the context needed to readd the tag to the aggregate state.

                        fun (x': TagsAggregate) -&gt;
                            x'.AddTag tag 
                            |&gt; Result.map (fun _ -&gt; [TagAdded tag])
                    return result
                }
            )
            |&gt; Some
        | AddTag t -&gt;
            // this case is simple than the previous because there is no need to retrieve anything from the context before the command is executed. The context is the tag itself (particularly its id), that is not lost during the transaction.
            (fun (_: TagsAggregate) -&gt;
                fun (x': TagsAggregate) -&gt;
                    x'.RemoveTag t.Id 
                    |&gt; Result.map (fun _ -&gt; [TagAdded t])
                |&gt; Ok
            )

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="application-service-layer"><a class="header" href="#application-service-layer">Application service layer</a></h1>
<p>An application service layer provides services that actually uses Respository and Storage to get the state and/or send commands to one or more aggregates eventyally in an atomic/transactional way.</p>
<p>Here is one of the simplest example of an entry for a services involving a single aggregate, by builing and running a AddTag command.</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    member this.addTag tag =
        result {
            let! _ =
                tag
                |&gt; AddTag
                |&gt; (runCommand&lt;TagsAggregate, TagEvent&gt; storage)
            return ()
        }
</code></pre>
<p>The service layer sends commands to the repository so that it can produce and store related events.</p>
<p>The following example shows a service function that uses two aggregates and an explicit lock (note the lock object concept to handle transaction has been substituted by a mailboxprocessor based actor model).</p>
<p>I will show an example involving the new version right after this one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    member this.addTodo todo =
        lock TagsAggregate.LockObj &lt;| fun () -&gt;
            ResultCE.result {
                let! (_, tagState) = getState&lt;TagsAggregate, TagEvent&gt;(storage)
                let tagIds = tagState.GetTags() |&gt;&gt; (fun x -&gt; x.Id)

                let! tagIdIsValid =    
                    (todo.TagIds.IsEmpty ||
                    todo.TagIds |&gt; List.forall (fun x -&gt; (tagIds |&gt; List.contains x)))
                    |&gt; boolToResult &quot;A tag reference contained is in the todo is related to a tag that does not exist&quot;

                let! _ =
                    todo
                    |&gt; TodoCommand.AddTodo
                    |&gt; (runCommand&lt;TodosAggregate, TodoEvent&gt; storage)
            return ()
        }
</code></pre>
<p>The todo can be added only if it contains valid tag references.</p>
<p>Now I am showing how I decided to deal with the same issue by using the mailboxprocessor, part of FSharp core library, that allows to process messages in a single thread.</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">        member this.AddTodo todo =
            let f = fun () -&gt;
                ResultCE.result {
                    let! (_, tagState) = storage |&gt; getState&lt;TagsAggregate, TagEvent&gt; 
                    let tagIds = tagState.GetTags() |&gt;&gt; (fun x -&gt; x.Id)

                    let! tagIdIsValid =    
                        (todo.TagIds.IsEmpty ||
                        todo.TagIds |&gt; List.forall (fun x -&gt; (tagIds |&gt; List.contains x)))
                        |&gt; boolToResult &quot;A tag reference contained in the todo is related to a tag that does not exist&quot;

                    let! _ =
                        todo
                        |&gt; TodoCommand.AddTodo
                        |&gt; runCommand&lt;TodosAggregate, TodoEvent&gt; storage
                    let _ = 
                        storage
                        |&gt; mkSnapshotIfInterval&lt;TodosAggregate, TodoEvent&gt;
                return ()
            }
            async {
                return processor.PostAndReply (fun rc -&gt; f, rc)
            }
            |&gt; Async.RunSynchronously
</code></pre>
<p>The entire expression is wrapped in an async block and the processor.PostAndReply function is used to send the function f to the mailboxprocessor and wait for the result.</p>
<p>This approach is extremely simple and effective but may slow down the processing of commands if the aggregate is involved in a long running transaction.</p>
<p>In some cases we may prefer explicit locks, in some cases it could be more convenient to use the mailboxprocessor and in other cases we may not use any lock at all!</p>
<p>Consider for example the addTodo:  if you do it without any locking and wighout any single thread mailboxprocessor based action, then you may end up with in inconsistencies like storing an event that is actually invalid (because the todo contains an invalid tag, or the todo is duplicated).
In that case the event is stored by given that it is inconsistent, it will be ignored when the aggregate will be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Another example is the following, about sending commands to more aggregates.
This code removes the tag with any reference to it. It build two commands and make the repository process them at the same tim.
This code remove a tag and any reference to it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    member this.removeTag id =
        ResultCE.result {
            let removeTag = TagCommand.RemoveTag id
            let removeTagRef = TodoCommand.RemoveTagRef id
            let! _ = runTwoCommands&lt;TagsAggregate, TodosAggregate, TagEvent, TodoEvent&gt; storage removeTag removeTagRef
            return ()
        }
</code></pre>
<p>With reference to the example involving the &quot;under&quot; of a command: the runTwoCommands function is executed in a transactional context if the storage supports multiple streams transactions (i.e. Postgres or in memory).
In the case the storage does not support multiple streams transactions (i.e. Eventstoredb) the runTwoCommands function will execute the two commands in a sequence and uses the undoer (if provided) to rollback the effect of the first command in case the second command fails.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="repository"><a class="header" href="#repository">Repository</a></h1>
<p>The repository has the responsibility of:</p>
<ul>
<li>getting the state of an aggregate</li>
<li>trying to run commands passed, and eventually storing the related events.</li>
<li>making periodic snapshots, according to the SnapshotsInterval parameter of the aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here an example of the private member that retrieve the last snapshot:</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    let inline private getLastSnapshot&lt;'A 
        when 'A: (static member Zero: 'A) 
        and 'A: (static member StorageName: string)
        and 'A: (static member Version: string)&gt;
        (storage: IStorage) = 

        ResultCE.result {
            let! result =
                match storage.TryGetLastSnapshot 'A.Version 'A.StorageName  with
                | Some (snapId, eventId, json) -&gt;
                    let state = SnapCache&lt;'A&gt;.Instance.Memoize (fun () -&gt; json |&gt; deserialize&lt;'A&gt;) snapId
                    match state with
                    | Error e -&gt; Error e
                    | _ -&gt; (eventId, state |&gt; Result.get) |&gt; Ok
                | None -&gt; (0, 'A.Zero) |&gt; Ok
            return result
        }
</code></pre>
<p>This function use the storage to retrieve a triple of the snapshotId, the related eventId and the snapshot itself, serialized as json.
Note that the snapshot may be cached in memory, so that the deserialization is done only once.</p>
<p>To get the current state of an aggregate we need to get the last snapshot and the events that are after the snapshot.</p>
<p>Here is an older version of how to get the state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Fsharp">    let inline getState&lt;'A, 'E
        when 'A: (static member Zero: 'A)
        and 'A: (static member StorageName: string)
        and 'A: (static member Version: string)
        and 'A: (static member LockObj: obj)
        and 'E :&gt; Event&lt;'A&gt;&gt;(storage: IStorage) = 

        let snapIdStateAndEvents()  =
            lock 'A.LockObj ( fun _ -&gt;
                ResultCE.result {
                    let! (id, state) = getLastSnapshot&lt;'A&gt; storage
                    let events = storage.GetEventsAfterId 'A.Version id 'A.StorageName
                    let result =
                        (id, state, events)
                    return result
                }
            )

        ResultCE.result {
            let! (lastSnapshotId, state, events) = snapIdStateAndEvents()
            let lastEventId =
                match events.Length with
                | x when x &gt; 0 -&gt; events |&gt; List.last |&gt; fst
                | _ -&gt; lastSnapshotId 
            let! events' =
                events |&gt;&gt; snd |&gt; catchErrors deserialize&lt;'E&gt;
            let! result =
                events' |&gt; evolve&lt;'A, 'E&gt; state

            return (lastEventId, result)
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Now I am showing how it is working in a way that the current state can also be cached.</p>
<pre><code class="language-FSharp">    let inline getState&lt;'A, 'E
        when 'A: (static member Zero: 'A)
        and 'A: (static member StorageName: string)

                            (id, state, events)
                        return result

                return storage.TryGetLastEventId 'A.Version 'A.StorageName |&gt; Option.defaultValue 0

<p>In the above code, the state is function of the event stream, and so we can use this eventId as the key of a cache that stores the state of the aggregate.</p>
<p>Note that here the evolve function is used, which is part of the core library and is defined as follows:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="refactoring-strategy"><a class="header" href="#refactoring-strategy">Refactoring strategy</a></h1>
<p>Here I am showing a strategy for refactoring aggregates in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>moving the models ownership between aggregates, </li>
<li>introducing new aggregates </li>
<li>upgrading old aggregates.</li>
<li>dropping aggregates.</li>
</ul>
<p>It looks more convenient having few aggregate, in a development and prototyping stage because this will simplify testing, prototyping, building the application service layer.
Consider that having everithing in a single aggregate would mean that the application service layer will be able to handle all the models with few lines of code (just building single command for the repository)</p>
<p>However, at a later stage, a proper refactoring is probably needed by moving models to different aggregates or creating new aggregates for performance reasons.</p>
<p>Refactoring aggregates in that sense means leaving the application service layer behavior unchanged.</p>
<p>The steps that may be followed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>defining new aggregates and eventually create upgraded version of current aggregates</li>
<li>moving models ownership from old aggregates to new aggregates (or to updated versions of the same aggregates which is the same)</li>
<li>creating an upgraded version of the application service layer using the new set of aggregates</li>
<li>applying the equivalent tests of the previous service layer to the new one.</li>
</ul>
<p>About this latest point, a parametric testing strategy is also possible.</p>
<p>Here is anexample of a list of tuples of multiple application version configuration with migration function.</p>
