# Models

Models (unofficial term) are collections of basic entities like records.
A model can contain references to elements of other models only indirectly, for example using external ids.

A Simple model for todo items:

```FSharp
    type Todo =
        {
            Id: Guid
            CategoryIds : List<Guid>
            TagIds: List<Guid>
            Description: string
        }
    type Todos =
        {
            todos: List<Todo>
        }
        with
            static member Zero =
                {
                    todos = []
                }
```
